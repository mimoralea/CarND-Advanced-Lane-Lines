## Advanced Lane Finding

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply the distortion correction to the raw image. 
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view"). 
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find lane boundary.
* Determine curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
* Test algorithm on images `test_images`
* Test algorithm on video `challenge_video.mp4`
* Test on own camera.
* Test on simulator.
* Create RL that relies on this pipeline.

**NOTES:**
The images for camera calibration are stored in the folder called `camera_cal`.  
The images in `test_images` are for testing your pipeline on single frames.  
The video called `project_video.mp4` is the video your pipeline should work well on.  
`challenge_video.mp4` is an extra (and optional) challenge for you if you want to test your pipeline.
